****<h1>💡 Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease Using Machine Learning</h1>****

This project focuses on developing a Machine Learning-based Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) prediction system capable of identifying early signs of CKD using clinical patient data. The system uses data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms—primarily the Random Forest model—to classify whether a patient has CKD or not.

Early detection of CKD helps prevent severe kidney damage and improves patient outcomes. This project aims to support healthcare professionals through an automated, accurate, and efficient CKD prediction tool.

<h4>XGBoost</h4>

Both models achieved high AUC values, with Random Forest performing slightly better in distinguishing CKD vs Non-CKD classes.

<h2>🔍 Predicted Output Example</h2>

A sample prediction demonstrates the system correctly classifying a patient’s clinical parameters as “CKD Present” or “CKD Not Present.”

**<h2>✔️ Key Observations</h2>**

Serum Creatinine, Hemoglobin, and Blood Urea showed strong influence on model prediction.

Feature selection helped improve the accuracy and reduce noise.

The model handled missing values effectively after preprocessing.

Performance remained stable even when evaluated with cross-validation.

The system proves to be:

Accurate (93%)
